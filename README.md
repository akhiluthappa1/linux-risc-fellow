# Process List Utility

This Python utility accepts a list of integers, removes items at positions that are multiples of 2 or 3, and checks if the list's length is a multiple of 10. It is designed to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts, error handling, and unit testing with `pytest`.

## Description

`process_list.py` is a simple Python script that processes a list of integers based on specific criteria. This utility is particularly useful for educational purposes, showcasing how to manipulate lists, implement conditional logic, and perform input validation in Python.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pytest (for running unit tests)

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install `pytest`, run:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

# Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhiluthappa1/risc-fellow.git
cd risc-fellow
```

# Executing Program
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python process_list.py
```
You will be prompted to enter a list of integers separated by spaces. The processed list will be printed to the console.

# Testing

To ensure the utility works as expected, unit tests have been provided in test_process_list.py. To run these tests, execute:

```bash
pytest test_process_list.py
```
